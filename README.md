# Learning v1 - The "I Survived CoreData" Trophy App üèÜ

## Vibe Check ‚ú®

Yo, this app is literally just me trying not to lose my mind while learning CoreData on macOS. No cap, it's a task manager that nobody asked for BUT it exists because I needed to figure out how this whole SwiftUI + CoreData situation works. It's giving programmer tears with a side of "why did I choose this career?" vibes.

If you're also on that "let me torture myself with Apple frameworks" journey, welcome bestie! ‚úåÔ∏è

## Features (aka Things That Actually Work Somehow??)

- ‚úÖ **CoreData Integration**: Managed to make data stick around between app launches without crying (much)
- ‚úÖ **MVVM Pattern**: Attempted this cursed architecture and lived to tell the tale
- ‚úÖ **Task Lists**: Create different lists to organize your tasks (or don't, I'm not your mom)
- ‚úÖ **Task Items**: Add items that you'll probably never complete IRL
- ‚úÖ **Due Dates**: Set deadlines that will haunt you in your sleep
- ‚úÖ **Sidebar Aesthetic**: It's giving macOS design system realness

## Tech Stack (AKA What I Suffered Through)

- **SwiftUI**: Apple's way of saying "we rewrote UIKit but make it ‚ú®functional‚ú®"
- **CoreData**: The ancient beast that eats junior developers for breakfast
- **MVVM**: Not to be dramatic, but this design pattern is LITERALLY hell, 0/10 would not recommend unless you're a masochist fr fr
- **Swift**: The language that keeps girlbossing with unnecessary syntax changes every WWDC

## Code Structure (it's a mess but it's organized chaos)

- **App Entry Point**:
  - `learningv1App.swift`: Where the chaos begins

- **Screens**:
  - `HomeScreen.swift`: The main character of this disaster movie

- **Views**:
  - `SideBarView.swift`: For switching between different flavors of anxiety
  - `MyListsView.swift`: Where lists go to be forgotten
  - `MyListItemsView.swift`: Displays all the things you should be doing instead of learning CoreData
  - `AddNewListItemView.swift`: For adding more things you'll procrastinate on
  - `ListItemCell.swift`: The representation of your failure to complete tasks

- **The Pain Center**:
  - `CoreDataManager.swift`: The reason I now have trust issues

## How to Run This Beautiful Disaster

1. **Requirements**:
   - A Mac that can handle emotional damage
   - Xcode (latest version because Apple said so)
   - Patience (not included in Xcode)
   - Energy drink (recommended)

2. **Installation**:
   - Clone this repo or whatever
   - Open `learningv1.xcodeproj` and pray it doesn't immediately crash
   - Hit that play button and watch Xcode think about life for a while
   - If it builds first try, literally no one will believe you

3. **First Steps**:
   - Create a list, add some tasks
   - Watch in awe as CoreData actually saves your stuff
   - Take a screenshot as proof you made MVVM work 

## The Tea ‚òï

This project was built purely to understand the unhinged nightmare that is CoreData and the questionable life choices that led to MVVM. Learning is pain, and this app is the receipt.

MVVM + CoreData = high-key cursed combo but we move üíÖ

## TL;DR

Made this app to learn stuff. It works (mostly). CoreData is my villain origin story. MVVM should come with a therapist. No thoughts, just persistent containers.
